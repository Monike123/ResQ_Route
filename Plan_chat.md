### User Input

so listen use the plugin gsd to formulate the indetail and in depth plan for the project go through this files {"file":{"absoluteUri":"file:///c%3A/Users/Manas/Desktop/ResQ%20Route/Project_Plan","workspaceUrisToRelativePaths":{"file:///c%3A/Users/Manas/Desktop/ResQ%20Route":"Project_Plan"}}} 

our backend will be supabase
ill give the credentials while on the phase of backend setup

the new directory named Project_resQ_route

will consist of our plan the best version and proper plan of how we are going to excuate a phase based plan and each point on each phase will have its seprate in depth and indetail md file of how to implement

i have setup the .venv for any python based 

our app will be in flutter
also include all security checks and 

create a git repo for each phasse and proper back up 

this chat will be only for planning and add of new stuff to the project 

else there will be 2 chats
1 : Project implmenting from the files
2 : error and debuger solving errors faced after the build from chat 2

ill interchange and properly keep everything in connec you dont woory of chat 

just your are the planner chat
so properly do your task with proper accuracy and precision

so also adk me for any issue or question dont assume or halucinate 
now go though all files and what i have written above and properly excute it

### Planner Response

Good, I found the GSD plugin and all the project plan files. Let me now read the GSD planner agent and the master blueprint, then systematically go through all the project files.

### Planner Response

Now let me find the full path and read the GSD planner and all the project files:

*User accepted the command `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "gsd-planner.md" -Path "C:\Users\Manas\Desktop\ResQ Route" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -ExpandProperty FullName; Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "gsd-planner.md" -Path "C:\Users\Manas\.gemini" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -ExpandProperty FullName`*

### Planner Response

Good, found it at [C:\Users\Manas\.gemini\agents\gsd-planner.md](cci:7://file:///Users/Manas/.gemini/agents/gsd-planner.md:0:0-0:0). Now let me read the GSD planner and all project plan files in parallel:

### User Input

the plugin is integrated in antigravity and if not found integrate it for our project
https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done

### Planner Response

Good note — I can see the GSD plugin is already integrated in your `.gemini` directory with all its agents, commands, and workflows. I'll leverage the GSD methodology (phase-based planning, task breakdown, dependency graphs, goal-backward verification) to create your comprehensive project plan. Let me continue reading all the remaining project files.

### Planner Response

Now I have read ALL 16 project specification files and the GSD planner methodology. I also read the GSD roadmapper agent. Let me now also check the image file to understand the UI:

Now I have a complete understanding of the entire project. Let me now create the comprehensive phased plan. The key adaptations from the original specs are:

1. **Flutter** instead of React Native (as the user specified)
2. **Supabase** instead of custom FastAPI + PostgreSQL (as the user specified)
3. Phase-based structure with individual detailed MD files per point
4. Git repo per phase with proper backup

Let me now create the task tracking file, the master plan, and then the detailed phase files.

### Planner Response

Now let me create the task file and start building the comprehensive plan. First, the task tracking, then the master plan:

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

Now let me create the comprehensive master plan. Since this is purely a planning task (not code changes), I'll create the project planning documents directly. Let me start with the master plan:

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

Now let me create the Git Strategy, Security Checklist, and begin the detailed phase files. Since this is purely a planning/documentation task (no code changes), I'll create an implementation plan focused on the plan itself, then proceed with the detailed phase files.

### Planner Response

This is a pure planning/documentation task — there are no code changes, so I don't need an implementation plan for code. I'm creating project planning documents. Let me continue creating all the files:

### User Input

the directory Project_resQ_route
will be in this folder only also intialise git repo okay
uner this repo
echo "# ResQ_Route" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Monike123/ResQ_Route.git
git push -u origin main

### Planner Response

Got it — the `Project_resQ_route` directory stays inside `ResQ Route` (which I'm already doing), and I'll initialize the git repo with your GitHub remote. Let me do that and continue creating all the phase files.

*User accepted the command `cd "c:\Users\Manas\Desktop\ResQ Route" ; git init ; git remote add origin https://github.com/Monike123/ResQ_Route.git ; echo "# ResQ_Route" > README.md ; git add README.md ; git commit -m "first commit" ; git branch -M main`*

### Planner Response

Good, git initialized. Now let me push to the remote and continue creating all the phase files:

*User accepted the command `git push -u origin main`*
