App Concept: "Safe Route App" ()
Core Logic: Unlike Google Maps, which optimizes for time, this app optimizes for safety and provides active monitoring during the trip.

Phase 1: Authentication & Setup (Trust Layer)
Step 1: Identity Verification:

login info:
contact no. 
passowrd

The user opens the app. If new, they Sign Up.

signup info:
contact no.
email id
aadhar details/ PNA card details
password
slect emergency contacts no. 

They must provide Aadhar/PAN details. Working: The app verifies this against government APIs to ensure no "fake profiles" are using the app to stalk others.

Step 2: Emergency Circle:

The user selects 3 Verified Contacts from their phone book.

System Action: The app saves these numbers locally and on the server to ensure SMS/Alerts go out even if the app crashes.

Phase 2: Route Planning (Pre-Trip Awareness)
Step 3: Destination Input:

The user enters their destination on the Home Page.

Visualizing Danger: Before selecting a route, the map displays red flags indicating "Unsafe Zones" (historical data on flagged by other users, etc.) so the user is aware of areas to avoid.

Step 4: The "Safest" Selection:

The algorithm calculates routes based on "SAFETY SCORES" using crimes data and severity of crime using gemini API to search for crimes happened on every road on the paths.

The user sees 3 cardswith safety score out of 100%:

Safest 1 (Recommended): Highest safety score, might be slightly longer.

Safest 2: Good balance of safety and time.

Safest 3: Shortest, but with acceptable safety rating.

Step 5: The Safety Handshake:

Before clicking "Start," the user toggles "Share Live Location."

System Action: An SMS link is instantly sent to the 3 contacts: "User X has started a trip to [Location]. Track them here."

Phase 3: The Journey (Active Monitoring)
This is the most critical phase where the app is "watching" the user.

Feature A: SOS button 

The app UI has button on page of SOS which works with 5 secs touch

Feature B: Voice-Activated SOS (Hands-Free)

The app listens in the background for a specific key phrase (e.g., "HELP SAFE APP").

Working: If the user screams this phrase, the app triggers the SOS mode immediately without needing to unlock the phone or touch the screen.

Feature C: The "Stationary" Deadman Switch

The GPS monitors movement.

Logic: If the user's location coordinates do not change by more than 10 meters for 20 minutes:

Phone Vibrates: A notification asks "Are you okay?"

Countdown: A 60-second timer begins.

Trigger: If the user does not tap "I'm Okay," the app assumes they are incapacitated or detained and auto-sends an SOS alert with the last known location to the 3 contacts and local emergency services.

Feature D: Flagging Unsafe Areas (Crowdsourcing)

While walking, if the user sees a broken street light or a suspicious group, they tap the "Flag Unsafe Area" button.

Working: This drops a pin on the server map. If multiple users flag the same spot, it becomes a permanent "Red Flag" on Page 3 for future users.

Phase 4: Emergency Response (If needed)
The SOS State:

If SOS is triggered (via Button, Voice, or Timer):

Contacts are notified, other national emergency services are notified (like ambulance, police, etc)
Live location is shared at high frequency (every 20 seconds).

Phase 5: Completion & Reporting
Step 6: Arrival:

The user reaches the destination. The Live Location link expires/stops sharing.

Step 7: SRR (Safe Route Report):

A popup summarizes the trip.

SRR button along side of SOS button throughout the journey

Journey Summary:
Traveler: [User Name] (Verified via Aadhar/PAN)
Duration:(Est: 40 mins)
Distance
Route Details:
Source
Destination
Route Selected
crimes on routes
Safety Diagnostics:
Safety Score: 94/100 (High)
Commercial Points Passed: 14 (Shops, ATMs, Fuel Stations)

Action: The user can download this as a PDF (useful for claiming travel expenses or filing police complaints if an incident occurred).

[ DOWNLOAD PDF ] [ SHARE REPORT ]

Step 8: Feedback:

The user rates the safety of the path (1-5 stars).

This data feeds back into the algorithm to help generate "Safest 1" routes for other users tomorrow.

user can download the SRR report (optional)

Summary of Logic Flow
Input: Destination + User ID.

Process: Algorithm scans map for Commercial Points + User Flags -> Generates 3 Safe Routes.

Monitor: GPS tracks movement + Microphone listens for Keywords.

Trigger: IF (Stop > 20min) OR (Voice = "Help") -> THEN (Alert Contacts).

Output: Safe Arrival + Data for future safety.
